== The Flat Earth Museum

We are working hard to refute the hypocrisies of round earth theory.

There has been a long history of round eath theorists.  These ideas have proliferated to the point
that flat earth science has been dismissed as absurd and ridiculed by the mainstream.  This website
aims to reestablish the science behind a flat earth and eventual show people the error of their ways.

From Pythagoras to Galileo to Magellan, many people have been pushing the round earth agenda.  While most 
people now 'believe' this theory, they do not actually understand it.  In fact, there is still no proper 
explanation of why people on the bottom of the earth don't fall off.  

This and many other round earth theory discrepencies will be addressed and solved. 

The flat earth museum, coming soon!
